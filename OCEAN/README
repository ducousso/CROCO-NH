-----------------
Roms_Agrif makes use of a script (jobcomp) in order to produce a generic 
Makefile (write machine-dependent definitions in "Makedefs" included in 
the Makefile). Currently, jobcomp takes care automatically of Linux, 
Compaq, and IBM systems. 

Global flags are defined in cppdefs.h (as usual for Roms). Flags are 
available to switch on/off AGRIF. In case where AGRIF is switched off, 
Roms is back to "normal" and can be compiled with a 77 fortran compiler
(no pointers used).

Parallelization with OpenMP or MPI can be used by turning the appropriate 
flags.
